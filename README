An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world. It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
Worked more on the spec designer. Have mostly moved around stuff. It should be noted that I need to rework the "ModuleManager" type to make it easier to search through the modules. At this moment I have implemented a new function, called "lseek", in the "core" namespace to get around this. It performs a linear search.
