An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world. It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
Have started to implement the spec designer. It consists of a new type called "DesignerView" in the "ui" namespace. At the moment it is not complete, and you cannot actually create a new spec yet, but you can visit it and check it out.

A new "bind" function has been added to the "core" namespace. This function takes two arguments. The first is an object, the second a function or method. It returns a function. When that function is called, it will call the second argument with the first argument as "this" and whatever arguments has been given the function will be passed along. This is basically a way to avoid having to write a function just to call a method on another object.

Have also fixed a few bugs that occured because some code was used that worked in Firefox but not other web browsers. This has been corrected. Must remember to test in more browsers :P.

Have also played around a little with the ui, most notably the appearence of some of the buttons.
