An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world. It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
Bug fixes and a few updates to the spec designer ui. There are still a couple of bugs that need to be sorted out. For example, its only possible to select the hull once atm.
