An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world.
It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to
create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
Have mainly implemented some optimizations, hoping to improve performance. Have also managed
to get it to work in Internet Explorer 9 (have not tested an earlier version yet), which didnt
work earlier due to a css issue. A bug, which made so the player could not enter a selected system
through double clicking, has been fixed.
