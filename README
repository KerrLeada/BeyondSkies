An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world. It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
More bug fixes. ModuleManager now also takes a different kind of object when modules are added directly to it during construction. More specifically, it takes any object that implements a "forEach" method.
