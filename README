An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world. It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
Have remade the way colonization works. Basically now every civilization has a "ColonyManager" which keeps track of all the colonies as well as how much income and production they create. A "Planet" object still has a "colony" property, but that property is now null when no one has a colony on it. Colonization is now done through the "colonize" method of a "Civ" object and the "colonize" method of a "StarSystem" object has been removed.

Smaller changes include renaming all "owner" properties to "civ". Have also made the income lower so that buttons wont be pushed around as much (at this stage it doesnt matter, will fix that later).

Money and production cannot be used yet.
