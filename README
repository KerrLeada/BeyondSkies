An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world. It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
Bug fixes. Lots of them. Still not entierly working, though. Basically, how modules and ships are handled are being reworked so that new specs can be created in a good way (I hope its a good way, anyway :P).
