An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world. It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
The module system has been reworked. The "ModuleView" type has been removed. So has "ModuleRegister". Modules no longer have a "register" method. Rather, the "ShipSpec" constructor simply takes an object that it gets the weapons, sensors and other modules from. The colonization module belongs to the "other" category.

The "Hashtable" type has gotten a new method called "map", which applies the content of the "Hashtable" instance to a given function and returns an array containing the results.

A new "Designer" button has appeared at the top of the screen. This is because the next thing planned is to make a ship designer, so the player can use the module system to create their own ship specs.

A few general bug fixes has been done as well.
