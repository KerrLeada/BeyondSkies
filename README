An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world. It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
Fixed the bug that prevented the ships from moving. Also fixed a bug that prevented the starmap from displaying what systems are in range of the selected ships.
