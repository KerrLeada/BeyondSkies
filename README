An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world. It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
A rather significant rewrite of the code, to make it cleaner and/or more maintainable. I hope, anyway. the changes has a lot to do with the new "defineProps" function in the "core" namespace, which makes it easier to create constant properties for an object (they cannot be deleted or changed). Other changes involves making sure that things that are expected to change will be changed through methods rather then directly changing a property. The rule of the thumb is that constants are properties and things that changes are methods, from a user of an objects point of view. The changes mainly involve the "world" namespace.

The "core" namespace also has a "frozen" function that makes so an object cannot be changed (dont think it affects an objects prototype, though). Its just a convienient way to use the "Object.freeze" method.
