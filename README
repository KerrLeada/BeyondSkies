An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world. It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
Minor update. Have added a "newCtor" function to the "core" namespace. It accepts a constructor function that the new constructor will get its prototype from, and a constructor function. It also makes so the constructor function can call a method called "_super", which basically calls the constructor function for the prototype. If "_super" already exists in the prototype it is not replaced.

Have also played around a little with colors and fonts and such.
