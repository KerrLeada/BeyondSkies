An experimental and web based 4x game, taking place in space beyond the skies of our world. It is created with html 5, javascript and php. The goal of the project is to explore how to create this kind of game using those tools.

Do note that this is a work in progress.

Note about the latest:
Have added two types. The "Hud" type resides in the "ui" namespace and can be called to show information about stuff in a window-like thing. The "Star" type resides in the "world" namespace and represents the star of a system. A new function, "sealed", has also been added to the "core" namespace. This function will seal and then return any given object.

What these changes has made is so now you can click a star to show information about it. At the moment this information isnt that varied. More variation is however planned. Its also planned to make so you can get information about a planet in a similar fashion.

Need to figure out a better way to handle many arguments, since some functions are getting a bit silly.
